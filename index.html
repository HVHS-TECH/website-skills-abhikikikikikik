      <h2>About Myself</h2>
      <p>
        I'm student who has a few different hobbies. I sometimes play the guitar
        and have learned how to play a few songs. When I’m not practicing the
        guitar, I might be watching tv, playing games, or cooking in the kitchen
        since I know how to make a few meals.
      </p>

      </ul>

      <h2>For My Teacher</h2>
      <p>
        Something that helps me learn best is having clear instructions to
        follow from and getting help when I need it. I don't really care about
        working together or alone, or the sound in a room, I can work fine in
        any environment under any conditions or certain criterias.
